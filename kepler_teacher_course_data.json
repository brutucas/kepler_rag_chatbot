        "name": "Danae Harlow",
        "bio": "Danae grew up in Salem, OR and attended a local classical Christian school. In 3rd grade she was introduced to Latin, and it quickly became her favorite subject. In high school she had a dynamic Latin teacher who really made Latin come alive and feel like a real language; it was then, at age 15, she knew God was calling her to be a Latin teacher who makes Latin fun and profitable for her students. With that goal in mind, Danae moved to Moscow, ID in 2010 and attended New Saint Andrew's College (NSA), where she took every Latin class she could. While in college she taught a few math and science classes at a local homeschool coop, and also worked for NSA tutoring other Latin students. She landed her dream job of teaching JH & HS Latin at Logos School (Moscow, ID) in 2013, where she spent her days acting out Latin words and scenes, simplifying difficult grammar concepts, and encouraging students to make Latin their own. After marrying Jordan Harlow and having their first son in 2021, Danae now teaches a few Latin classes online for various schools, as well as teaching in person at her alma mater, NSA. Other than teaching and tutoring Latin, Danae's hobbies include teaching horse riding lessons, directing JH & HS plays, acting in community theater, and singing in the church choir.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "To know the facts is not enough - true learning only takes place when a student can use the material in their own way, and understand it on its own terms. This is why Danae's goal in teaching is to get the students to go beyond memorizing paradigms and vocabulary, and to rather understand Latin as a real and living language. Through reading, composing, and speaking, students are taught not only how to learn Latin, but how to learn any language. God created this wonderful world, and to learn another language is to learn a whole new way to understand and discuss his creation. Danae loves to see her students realize that they can, even in a first or second year Latin class, start to see words and ideas in a different way, and that they can read and understand this other language like their own. In a few short years, students would then be able to access first-hand rich classical and Christian texts, and to read them almost like they would read English.",
        "statement_of_faith": "Danae is a Reformed Christian who believes in the lordship of God the Father, the atonement of God the Son, and sanctification of God the Spirit. She grew up in a Christian home, and was baptized as a young believer. She has been a member at Trinity Reformed Church in Moscow, ID, for these last fourteen years.",

These Latin curricula focus on learning the logic of Latin by putting the grammar in the perspective of stories. For this reason, the texts are all in Latin (that’s right, no English!) and we only translate to check understanding. This helps teach Latin as a coherent language, and this fluidity gives the students the tools to write and speak their own Latin sentences. The innovative Picta Dicta curriculum contains both an online app and a textbook, Latin Primer II. Students will do most of the app exercises/games as homework, and these need to be completed before class time. As Latin is cumulative, students are expected to review regularly and to ask questions if a former concept is forgotten. Students will spend about 1-2 hours each week completing the Picta Dicta work outside of class.",

            "description": "An interactive Latin course for secondary homeschool students. This can be used as a first-year course or as the third year following Latin Primers 1 & 2. 'Picta Dicta Latin Grammar' is a hybrid digital-print introduction to Latin designed for the secondary level or beyond. Students first learn vocabulary, morphology, and syntax through thousands of illustrated cartoons. Then, they practice simple Latin composition, grammatical analysis, and reading in a physical workbook. The readings in this course are all original compositions that are simultaneously humorous and foundational for students preparing to read harder and more serious Latin texts. Students will do most of the app exercises/games as homework, and these need to be completed before class time. As Latin is cumulative, students are expected to review regularly and to ask questions if a former concept is forgotten. We will also tackle two accompanying readers to further solidify our Latin reading skills. Although it is titled Volume 3, Latin Grammar 3 is the first installment of this series. Students with no prior experience of Latin may use it as their first Latin course. However, students who have completed the preparatory course, 'Picta Dicta Latin Primer 1 & 2', will be well prepared for this course and will find the first 10 lessons mostly review.",

        "bio": "I live in Moscow, Idaho, and come from a long line of University of Idaho professors and graduates. Learning to love language was something that started for me in elementary school when my parents took us to live in the tiny desert town of Bobo Dioulasso in what had just become Burkina Faso. My siblings and I, not knowing a word of French, were dropped off at the local French school to sink or swim in a new language, country, and culture. Eventually, I was learning all of my subjects in French—math, grammar, history, music and everything else, and reading voraciously in both languages. I studied French and English at the University of Idaho, technical translation in France on a Rotary scholarship, and returned to the University of Idaho to complete my master’s degree in Teaching English as a Second Language. I went on to teach English in Japan for several years. My three children and I love to read together, cook, sew, learn about electronics, practice karate, and seek to bring everything we do under the banner of Christ.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "The bedrock of my educational philosophy is Jesus. “He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17). Because He is our Creator, we can count on such things as order and meaning, and we can assume that truth, beauty, and goodness exist, and we can aspire to them. “It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honor of kings is to search out a matter” (Proverbs 25:2). What we call an education is simply learning how to search out a matter. Learning is hard but not pointless work, although I don't think students need to see the point of everything they learn right away. We aren’t just teaching them for the final exam or to get a good job. Rather, we’re preparing our students to fulfill their calling as kings.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I grew up in a loving Christian home, which had the most consistent impact on my faith because we had to move every couple of years and find new churches along the way, discovering that the body of Christ is beautiful everywhere and that God is our loving and faithful Father no matter where we are. For the last 15 years or so, I have been an evangelical Reformed Christian. I’m a member of Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, holding to the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Westminster Confession, among other confessions. Weekly communion, Biblical teaching, singing all the Psalms, and a godly, prayerful, hospitable, and Bible-reading community are a few of my favorite things about our church.",

It is currently the 5th most common language in the world. French is a lovely, musical, and logical language that will help develop your critical thinking and appreciation for beauty. It shares many words and grammatical structures with English, making a rigorous study of French beneficial to your grasp of your own language. However, the language’s rich history ensures copious numbers of exceptions to every rule, which is guaranteed to help you work on your patience! This beginning French course will cover the standard vocabulary, grammar, and conversational elements of a high school French 1 course, and will as well give you a brief overview of the history, geography, culture of France. From the first day of class, you will begin working on correct French pronunciation. We’ll be building your ability to understand, speak, write, and read in French. Students will be expected to study and practice grammar, vocabulary, and memory work outside of class, including Scripture verses and practical conversations. There will be a test after each chapter which will include oral and written components. The course is open to 8th through 12th grade students.",

In his teenage years, he represented England at the national level and captained the most successful lacrosse team outside of North America. Following his university studies and year abroad (as a languages student), Benjamin pursued a gruelling year of school-based teacher training in former mining towns and socially-deprived areas. This nearly broke him, but he pressed on. For almost a decade, Benjamin has taught languages, humanities, ethics, sport (and common-sense) at boarding schools in England and Switzerland. He embraces every opportunity to expand his teacher toolkit and deepen his roots in this noble vocation.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "The work of a teacher to improve a student extends beyond the lesson and their influence reaches beyond the classroom. We are jigsaw pieces that must find the place in the puzzle where we discover our deepest satisfaction and most meaningful contribution. I guide pupils on this journey to uncover, harness, and apply unique talents and interests to their lives, families, and local communities – the starting point of lasting change. In different contexts and subjects, I point to the world with its many and problems, asking the questions: “What can you fix? What can you build?” This vision is the WHY behind my work. As students enhance their language and critical-thinking skills, they are encouraged to engage deeply with the cultures, histories, and cuisines of the target language, such as the Deutschraum or the Russkiy Mir from a Biblically-informed perspective. This distinctive approach of Christian language teaching transforms them from mere tourists to reformers in training, cultivating a critical eye for the good, true, and beautiful worldwide. Language serves as an essential gateway to these foreign cultures.",
        "long_bio": "Benjamin Lucas is a husband, father, and teacher in his late twenties, who is pursuing the call on his life to be a bright and salty signpost to the community of boys and staff in his boarding school. He never expected to be given this outpost in a quiet town nestled among the rolling hills of Old Wessex, but His ways are not his ways. The Holy Spirit gripped his soul whilst abroad in the former Soviet Union and revealed the palpable despair of a post-Christian culture - an irreversible decay without the lasting reconstruction of the Biblical alternative. Soon after this experience, he suffered from PTSD until he visited an actual warzone and (thanks to salty doctrine and the distributive power of YouTube) got his life and worldview in order. Benjamin would consider himself part of a tiny but growing movement of Christians, who have woken up to smell the coffee that the church in the West has failed. Dragons and giants really do exist, they infest the land, and the free peoples are being routed from the battlefield. The once-Christian lands of Europe and the British Isles appear lost, and there looms an enormous work of reconstruction to redefine every aspect of human existence according to God's law-word, not the latest idol that needs toppling à la Boniface. But all is not lost, and the promises of God are true and everlasting. It is time for faithful warriors everywhere to grasp their swords, raise the banner, and stand in defiance until His enemies become His footstool.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I am a born-again Christian, who was saved in my teenage years, and brought into a deeper theological maturity during my university years. I hold to the Westminster Confession and identify myself closest with the Reformed tradition. I have been ashamed by ongoing collusion of the English clergy with diabolical forces, and so my family is currently between churches. God does not reform apostate churches, nor does he pour new wine into old wineskins. Since the era of lockdowns and government overreach, we are working to establish new communities of believers across Europe and Britain with a long-term vision to build an alternative social order. Our vision recalls the 'Imperium in Imperio' to build the Kingdom and resist any and all encroaching tyranny with the threefold weapons of bread, wine and word.",

Teaching aims at the creation of another like the teacher. I aim above all to model for my students and to develop in them the combination of a due sense of wonder in the face of mysteries both created and uncreated. But at the same time, I want to model and develop rigor, expressed in precision and concision. Both rigor and wonder are applicable to every area of human endeavor, and they are essential to a healthy intellectual life. Finally, I believe that learning happens best in the context of joy, and so I strive to foster a classroom environment that is fun and playful, without sacrificing depth of engagement. With me, students find room for their voice, find their minds and hearts challenged, and do all of this in a fellowship of like-souled friends.",

While my own sensibilities are fairly liturgical and sacramental, I have spent significant time worshiping in every major expression of the Christian faith. I am sacramental in my spirituality, and also Evangelical, with a little bit of Charismatic thrown in, lest I forget that my understanding and the expectations of the modern world set no limit to the range of possibilities for God's far-reaching grace.",

Maybe you studied Latin so long ago that you’ve forgotten nearly everything; maybe you never studied Latin at all. But now you find yourself in the position of needing to answer your child’s questions about their Latin homework; or worse yet, you are trying to lead them through a curriculum, and are fighting to stay a chapter ahead of them amid your own busy schedule. Wouldn’t it be great to get the sort of solid grounding in Latin that would enable you to answer their questions with confidence, and even discuss with them their favorite parts of the language? If you don’t have time to learn Latin, but it feels like your kids are going further and further into a world you cannot follow, then this course is designed for you. In 4 meetings you will learn the fundamentals of Latin as concepts: that means that you don’t have to do the memorization work, but you will understand why it is important that your child do his or her memorization.

Since then, Christians in every age have worked to show that there is much that Athens has to offer Jerusalem, so long as it does not set itself up over Jerusalem as judge, but rather submits to it in service. The Church has remained committed to the belief that the faith, while it is mysterious, and so beyond our ability to exhaustively understand, is nevertheless reasonable. This year-long course will explore the relationship and interaction of philosophy and theology by considering the fundamental questions of each. Philosophy’s first question, for example, is: 'Why is there something rather than nothing?' Theology responds: 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.' Philosophy asks 'from what?' and theology responds: 'from nothing.' Philosophy asks 'for what reason?' and theology responds: 'for his own glory and pleasure.' Thus we will see that philosophy is characteristic of humans, for it is the discipline where we gather all of our questions of meaning. Every search for God begins in such questions, and so begins in philosophy; but a search for God that never rises above that first questioning stance will never arrive at God. And so we will see that when philosophy continually looks to theology to have its questions answered, it leads to deeper and more robust faith; but when it turns away from theology and seeks to set itself up as the highest arbiter of truth, it ends in confusion, skepticism, and despair.",

            "description": "Much of Latin seems counter-intuitive to English-speaking students. Seemingly arbitrary and very difficult features of the language like cases, word order, and the incredible number of verb forms not only make the language difficult to learn, they also take a major toll on student motivation. This course will tackle those issues by considering the weird aspects of Latin grammar from the standpoint of the fundamental goal of all language: communication. As we answer the many “why” questions about Latin that often go undiscussed in the regular course of study, students will discover a love of Latin and of language in general that will make them excited to continue in their study. (This course is supplemental to a normal course of Latin study; it does not replace it.)",

        "bio": "I discovered the beauty and richness of classical education when I began homeschooling my two boys nearly fifteen years ago. When I first learned about classical education I knew that this was the type of education I wanted for my children, (It was the type of education I wish I had had). Being a military family, we moved from place to place with frequency, and homeschooling allowed us stability in the midst of constant change. We were fortunate to be able to put down roots in Panama City, FL in 2015 which prompted me to found a Christian Classical homeschool co-op—Arete Homeschooling Collaborative. I have been the Director of the co-op since our first classes in 2016, and I teach various classes each year—my favorite of which are the Literature and Composition classes. One of life’s greatest joys is to see the light illuminated within my students, to see them begin to think about a story beyond the plot level, to question what a story is telling us about humanity, the world, and the journey of the human soul. A close 2nd to literature, I am also passionate about teaching Spanish. Like literature, learning another language expands a student’s understanding of the world, of creation, of the student’s own language, and introduces a measure of humility. I have had the opportunity to teach Spanish-English dual immersion 1st grade, English as a Second Language, and High School Spanish in public school before I began a family. Recently I taught Spanish I and II online to homeschoolers through another platform. I am thrilled to share my passion and experience for the Spanish language with Kepler students this year. I currently hold a M.Ed. in Bilingual/ESL education from the University of Central Oklahoma and am in the process of completing an M.A. in Humanities with an emphasis in Classical Education from the University of Dallas. In addition to a love of books and discussing books, I enjoy travel, nature, and pickleball. When I’m not curled up on my screened porch, surrounded by plants, cuddling with my dog and cat I can be found basking in the glory of God’s creation—kayaking down one of Florida’s beautiful natural springs, walking along one of our pristine beaches, hiking, or biking. Although I’ve had the opportunity to live in many different places across the U.S. and around the world (Costa Rica, Honduras, Japan, Nevada, Oklahoma, Missouri), my favorite place to live is always the place where I find myself right now, which at the moment happens to be Northwest Florida.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "My teaching philosophy is founded on the truth that students bear the imago Dei and are worthy of dignity, honor, and respect. As image-bearers all students have a capacity for reasoning and understanding. They are not receptacles for information to be fed into; neither are they objects to be molded into shape. Rather, they are humans capable of wonder with God’s law written into their hearts. My duty as a teacher is to work alongside parents in the cultivation of the humanity of my students. With parents, I serve as a guide to my students in the journey towards their telos—the ultimate end of becoming fully human by becoming Christ-like or in a single word: wisdom. My responsibility is to lead my students towards wisdom; therefore, I am as concerned with their souls as I am with their intellect. My goal as a teacher is to fan the flame of wonder within my students and direct their affections towards the higher things through meaningful encounters with truth, goodness, and beauty.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I believe that humans are created in the image of God and that we were created to be in communion with God. However, because of the introduction of sin into the world through the Fall in the Garden of Eden, we are separated from God. It was for this reason that God sent Christ into the world, born of the Virgin Mary and fully human. It is only because of Christ's death on the cross and resurrection into Heaven that the broken relationship with God is able to be reconciled. I currently am a member of First Presbyterian Panama City, a PCA (Presbyterian Church in America) Church. PCA churches teach from a reformed, Calvinist perspective; however, the co-op that I founded is multidenominational with students from Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Methodist, etc. backgrounds. I am sympathetic to the the specific beliefs of all my students, and as a teacher focus on what unites us instead of what divides us. I also believe that healthy discussions about our differences can lead to better understanding and strengthened relationships.",

As the mediaeval scholastics understood, the liberal arts lead us back to the knowledge of God, especially through the understanding of Holy Scripture.

I have embraced a ‘mixed methodology’ of language teaching which combines instruction in grammar, graded reading, and active use of the language. My goal is what C. S. Lewis achieved with the Great Knock: “I very soon became able to understand a great deal without (even mentally) translating it; I was beginning to think in Greek. This is the great Rubicon to cross in learning any language.” This approach to language-learning also cultivates in students the virtue of risk-taking, and they become better readers and communicators in general.",

This follows the fictitious adventures of Paul, Philemon and Onesimus, and is interspersed with other stories including adaptations of texts from the New Testament and the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament). These ‘sheltered’ narratives largely employ only the vocabulary and grammar to which students have been introduced up to that point. Students will develop an active knowledge of the language through writing and even speaking in Koine Greek. The goal is for students not to substitute English for the Greek, as if they were only solving a puzzle, but to read the Greek, as C. S. Lewis put it, “with no officious English word intruding.”",

        "bio": "I was born in Rochester, NY but have spent the majority of my adult life in the south. I do love the south as a unique place in God's creation. I have been blessed to serve at a few different institutions of education. In addition to teaching at a few different colleges and universities, I have enjoyed consulting with numerous Classical Christian schools and being the Headmaster for the past twenty years. I am fully committed to “thinking Christianly” about all that is. To use Paul’s words, I feel God’s pleasure when I take “captive every thought for Christ.” I have been blessed for more than twenty years seeking to honor God with the life of the embodied mind. I have long enjoyed the Great Books. We are a family of readers. Among my favorite authors are Homer, Plato, Cicero, Dante, Petrarch, Erasmus, Christina Rossetti, Flannery O’Connor, George MacDonald, C. S. Lewis, Ray Bradbury, Wendell Berry, and Richard Wilbur. In recent years I have really come to enjoy the novels of Ross MacDonald (detective fiction), Zoran Živković (very unique fiction), and Michael D. O’Brien (contemporary Catholic novelist with the depth and insight of Dickens, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky). Passionately committed to what C.S. Lewis described as “mere Christianity.” I acknowledge real differences that really matter. I also quickly affirm the truth of the consensus fidelium (consensus of the faithful) and its value against the onslaught of a divided Christendom and an anti-human humanism. My wife and children love camping and spending time with our families in Georgia and Alabama. At home, in North Carolina, we regularly have a seasonal puzzle underway and while loving our two cats, Lois and Lowry, have to discourage them from helping with the puzzle.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "During my years as a student and continuing on as an institutional leader, I have drawn several conclusions that have shaped my philosophy of education. The teachers, and later professors, who influenced me as it specifically related to my convictions about education and the manner in which I conduct myself as an academic leader, were knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and of sound character. Moreover, those same people treated me as a significant person. As a result, I strongly believe that the best teaching transcends techniques and models and is an extension of excellent character. I am a zealous teacher who thoroughly enjoys life in the academy. During my years of service, I have continued to increase my knowledge and fine-tune my teaching skills. Since I have been conscientious about the importance of the leader as a role model, I have attempted to cultivate various qualities most conducive to my sense of calling as a leader/teacher. It has been my experience that the most respected teachers possess patience, clarity, humility, a keen sense of humor, and kindness. As a teacher, I am guided by the principle to consider the perspectives and feelings of others.",
        "statement_of_faith": "It was a summer, Sunday evening and the minister had been preaching from I John. He had been speaking about the Love of God and I felt moved by the Spirit that evening to give my life to Christ. I remember being so touched by the depth and breadth of God’s love and that He wanted me as His child and to be part of His family. I went forward that evening and accepted Christ as my Lord and savior and have, by God’s grace and mercy, been growing in the fruit of the Spirit since that time. Over the years, people have spoken to me of the most prominent spiritual disciplines they see in my walk with the Lord. My brothers and sisters in Christ have encouraged me by describing how they have been blessed by my Christ-like service and spiritual disposition. They often describe me in terms of a “humble, patient, and peaceful servant”. It is my hope that my Lord also describes me in these terms. While I have identified with the Restoration tradition (Disciples of Christ/Christian Church/Church of Christ) I am passionately committed to what C.S. Lewis described as “mere Christianity.” I acknowledge real differences that really matter among sincere believers. I also quickly affirm the truth of the consensus fidelium (consensus of the faithful) and its value against the onslaught of a divided Christendom and an anti-human humanism. I readily call all my brothers and sisters who affirm the Apostle's and Nicene Creed within Christendom. Thomas Oden's Systematic Theology has profoundly shaped my theological convictions.",

        "teaching_philosophy": "The Classical Christian method encompasses the seven liberal arts of grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music; liberal from the Latin liber meaning “free” meaning the virtuous, wise and self-controlled man is free toward self- governance. As the Apostle Paul stated in Galatians 5:23, against such there is no law. Our founding Fathers understood this, as John Jay, First Supreme Court Justice, stated, our system of liberty and self-governance was designed for a Christian nation with elected Christian rulers. Or as John Adams, second President of the U.S. stated, our system of liberty and self-governance with the Bible as its basis would be wholly unsuitable for any group other than a virtuous, Christian people. And to that end, a couple of working definitions: The Christian educator believes we are called to teach Truth, Goodness (Godliness), and Beauty. Teaching is a calling to parents first and the church (Ephesians 6:4 and Deuteronomy 6:4-7). Teaching as a profession is a calling (Ephesians 4:11-16). There is Truth and God’s Word reveals it (John 17:17). Virtue is to be co-taught with knowledge (2 Peter 1:5-8). We are commanded to think on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report, virtuous and praiseworthy (Philippians 4:8). The Classical educator teaches a man to fish by providing the tools of learning and inculcating the joy of learning. The Classical Christian educator accomplishes both--molding the heart toward God and inculcating discernment of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty through tried and true methods of teaching. If we are to recover our nation’s moral compass, we must reignite educational excellence through a rediscovery of the centrality of Truth. There is Truth and we are called to teach it to the next generation (Deuteronomy 6 and Ephesians 6).",

I like to encourage students to search for truth in every area. I want them to understand that Christians have nothing to fear concerning recent advances in science but should always be prepared to give a sound answer in defense of their faith. I have a passion for sharing with students about the fingerprints of God in the universe that science unveils. My goal is to equip them to face the secular world with confidence by engaging in thoughtful dialogue.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I grew up going to church and became a Christian very early in life. During my college years, while pursuing a career in Astronomy I had a deep existential crisis and started to question my faith. Being aware of the amazing wisdom and ingenuity that underlies the laws of physics, I would never choose atheism. I knew there was a Creator, a great Architect for this universe and I knew He was very POWERFUL. However, for 2 long years, I wasn’t sure about the identity of the Designer of the universe. If He was an impersonal deity, force or someone I could have a relationship with. The God of Christianity was everything I would like to exist: a God that forgives, loves, calls you by name and shows amazing grace. But at the time there was a disconnect between these two Gods: One, the Creator of the universe that I knew existed and was extremely powerful. The other, the God of Christianity, that I would like to exist but wasn’t sure. At the time I could not see the power of God in my own life, so I kept searching and asking questions. The church I was attending in Rio at the time had a ministry with the homeless. In this ministry I observed deep life transformations. I saw the power of Jesus to restore and change lives rescuing people from addiction, violence, crime, abandonment. Not only Jesus’ power convinced me, but I also realized the love and forgiveness offered by Jesus was too generous to be a story invented by humans. Even though I have experienced other crisis in life, Jesus keeps showing me His grace when I fail. I’m fascinated by His personality and by His love. He is my reason for hope and joy, and I could not imagine living without Him.",

We are unique in our ability to not only experience the creation in which God placed us but to reflect upon those experiences, understand the underlying principles that God uses to govern creation, and act in accordance with those principles. The ability to learn and change is part of our image-bearing, and participation in learning facilitates this collective image-bearing. Perhaps most importantly, I can project a genuine wonder about the subjects I teach and invite the students along for an opportunity to discover how God’s world works with the reassurance that they have important contributions to make to the class’ journey. Ultimately a meaningful education will provide students with an eternal perspective to help inform their decisions. Education is not limited to the classroom and the school; it is part of every aspect of life and every experience. It is everything that brings us closer to the one who gives us not only meaningful life but eternal life.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I grew up in a rural community at a small church with my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and distant relatives. Prayer was part of mealtime, bedtime, and the beginning and end of all family events. I watched my grandmother pray through tears when my grandfather died, and I saw parents on their knees whenever there were struggles. My family continuously modeled reliance on a loving, involved Savior. The faith that my parents and grandparents passed on to me through their teaching would be strengthened after several years of marriage as we were told that I would likely not be able to have children. In these worst days, only strength from a God who did not spare His own Son allowed me to move forward. I would see the work God can do in a weak, fragile pot when, despite the words of that doctor, God blessed me with five children and developed in me a personal faith and total reliance on Him. I am still a member of a small church, St. Paul's Lutheran.",

Early in graduation he figured out that God had given him the talent for teaching. In 2010 he debuted as a teacher, teaching for a class of 60 people, in a program called EJA (youngs and adults education). That was a big challenge for the first day, but it became more natural class after class. At the same school, he had the opportunity to teach for high school students, with whom he felt a strong affinity. As soon as he finished the graduation, he started the master’s degree Biological Oceanography at the Universidade Federal de Rio Grande (FURG – Brazil), one of the most prestigious institutions in oceanography studies on Brazil. After the conclusion, he started teaching in 2014 on the private educational system and in 2019 he was invited to teach in junior high at a confessional institution, the Colégio Americano Batista (Sergipe – Brazil), when he teaches nowadays. Married to Sanny, father of Matias and Ana Clara. He has a love for music and plays the violin at church with other musicists who, like him, like to develop their musical talents, to enjoy the beauty of music, but specially to praise the Lord.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "As a teacher I believe that was entrusted to me the responsibility of being the intermediary between the student and the knowledge, so it is up to me to choose methodologies and materials that may help the student through the path. Different students may have different needs in this process, which brings the necessity of a sensibility to evaluate the individual needs and come up with solutions to each possible case, always working in partnership with the families to have more effectiveness in the learning/teaching process. As a Christian, I know that all truth is a truth of God, including the scientific truth, therefore, all knowledge is subordinate to the Holy Bible and under the major truth that God is the Lord of the universe and rules it according to predetermined laws, and reveals Himself to mankind through the things that have been made, according to Rm.1:20. To raise a fully virtuous human being it is necessary to look at him in a holistic way, it is mandatory that the knowledge has a rational, personal and spiritual value, meaning that when teaching about the winds and the oceans, the student learn about Jesus, who has the power to command the winds and the ocean, when learn about the physiology of breath, the student also learns the everything that breaths, awes praise to the Lord.",

He that came in flesh and died my death, so I could live His life, Jesus Christ, the Son. He who lives inside me and guides me through the paths of this life, the Holy Spirit. They, that are one, and revealed himself through history, the God of the covenant, that gave us Jesus Christ, whose blood washes away my sin and the evilness of my heart. I believe that I am a foreign in this world, going to a home I never saw, but that by faith I know, has a place for me, besides my God, where I shaw live for the eternity. Amen.

An infinite horizon of water, that once was thought to end at an abyss to the void, which depth was beyond human understanding until a few years ago, which storms frightened the most brave sailsman that sailed its waters looking for lands and richness. From the ages of the great navigation to the submarines and satellites mankind has discovered a lot about the oceans, and as much as we understand, we are convinced that our lives are directly influenced by it. The climate is influenced by the interaction ocean / atmosphere, the industrial fisheries feed the worlds tables, wars are decided at sea battles. The study of the oceans has never been so important as it is today. Many aspects can be considered while studying the ocean. During this year we will have a general comprehension of the ocean’s physics, chemistry and geology in order to prepare our students to study life at it. Starting from the elements that allow life on the ocean, our Marine Biology course will give the students the opportunity to know the diversity of life in the ocean, from the sunny sand beaches to the deep water creatures that will never see light, understanding the challenges of the many different saltwater habitats and the different tools God provided His creatures to overcome them. The students will also be encouraged and guided to discuss and understand the ecological and ethical questions about ocean resources exploration. As wardens and dominators of creation, humans have the obligation to watch over the health of our oceans, but also the power to rapaciously explore its resources with no care to preservation and sustainability. A biblical view of Marine Biology will lead us to respectfully explore it to the glory of God, in the fear of His name, because “The sea is His, for it was He who made it, and His hands formed the dry land.” (Psalm 95:5).",

After that, he conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell, where he helped teach and/or design a number of courses. His research focuses on disease carrying insects (primarily mosquitoes) and how understanding their biology and behavior can be used to prevent the spread of illness. He has been a member of numerous professional scientific societies, including Sigma Xi, the American Society of Parasitologists, the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and the Entomological Society of America. Garrett also earned degrees in biology from Baylor, where he studied visual development in an insect model system (the fruit fly), and TCU, where he minored in art and art history. In addition to science and art, Garrett has a lifelong love for the Bible and an admiration for Renaissance men, like Johannes Kepler, whose deep faith and broad expertise seamlessly bridged the sciences and humanities. He recently helped start a small home church as well as an online ministry called League of Believers, where he addresses the most important issues impacting the American Church and its public witness. Born and raised in Southern California, he and his wife now homeschool their three young children near Fort Worth, Texas.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "My approach to teaching can be summed up in two words: ethos and humilitas. In his classic work On Rhetoric, Aristotle considered ethos, or character, to be the most important element of persuasion among the three modes of rhetoric. Teachers with moral and ethical gravitas produce compelling, substantive students who cannot be ignored (Acts 4:13). More so than our pathos (emotion), or even our logos (reason), our impact as teachers reflects our ethos. In teaching young hearts and minds, we should above all strive to be like the Teacher (Matthew 23:10), and thus worthy ourselves of emulation (1 Corinthians 11:1). In academics, humilitas, or humility, manifests itself in a glad willingness to admit the limits of our creaturely knowledge and professional expertise. Once acquired, such vital self-awareness can be leveraged toward life-long learning under the auspices of God’s infinite wisdom. In his book Humilitas, the historian John Dickson states “What we don’t know and can’t do far exceeds what we do know and can do. A little humility, then, is hardly rocket science. It is common sense.” If we who have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16) follow his humble example (Philippians 2:1–11) in our instruction and scholarship, who knows what heights of learning we will together ascend to (1 Peter 5:6)?",
        "statement_of_faith": "I believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and inerrant word of God—as a biologist, I bow the knee to the truth of scripture and happily conduct all of my science education safely within its liberating confines (Psalm 18:30; Proverbs 30:5, 6; Galatians 5:1). I believe God created the entire cosmos and all its inhabitants out of nothing in the span of a single work week consisting of six solar days roughly six millennia ago (Genesis 1, 5, etc.; Exodus 20:11; Psalm 33:6–9; Hebrews 11:3). I believe that through man’s sin, the “very good” creation was subjected to futility, decay, and above all, death (Genesis 1–3; Romans 5:12, 8:20–22). I believe the gospel, or “good news,” of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:1–8) is the only hope of salvation for the fallen creation (Acts 4:12; Revelation 21:1–5). My church tradition is broadly evangelical, with an appreciation for, though by no means a slavish adherence to, the Reformed Protestant tradition. Just as Kepler’s approach to Classical Christian Education “strives to glean the best of Western liberal Education in every epoch,” so too my approach to the historic Christian faith seeks to honor the best insights of God’s people from every age and orthodox tradition of Church history. Thus my great appreciation for the Early Church Fathers and Medieval theologians does not prevent me from incorporating the best insights of, say, Baptist and Methodist teaching into my thinking and practice. I have had the privilege of co-leading, since 2022, a small home church that meets outside of Fort Worth, Texas. From this gathering was launched in 2023 the League of Believers, an online ministry dedicated to repentance and renewal in the American Church.

        "bio": "Barbara S. Helmkamp has a Ph.D. in physics from Louisiana State University (1995) and an engineering degree in physics from Colorado School of Mines (1986). Between undergraduate and graduate studies she worked in petroleum engineering (petrophysics) for the Shell Companies in New Orleans. This is where she met her husband, Bob. Barbara’s goal in obtaining her doctorate in physics was to teach at the college level, preferably at a Christian school, or to return to Shell Oil Company and work in a research capacity. However, being home with and for her children won out over working full-time, and she has since found much joy in secondary education. In 2007, having been asked to teach “Integrated Physics and Chemistry” at her daughters’ church school (St Mark, Houston), she also completed a course of study in theology through Concordia University Texas including studies in Old Testament, New Testament, Church History, and the Lutheran Confessions. Barbara especially enjoys speaking the gospel of Jesus Christ to students in a teaching context while bringing Scriptures and theology to bear on the subject matter. Now, for various reasons, she prefers teaching at a classical Christian high school or college via distance learning; that is, online. Barbara and Bob are members at Christ Our Savior Lutheran Church (LC‒MS) in Elizabeth, Colorado. Bob does engineering-consulting out of the home, having retired from Shell Oil Company in 2008 when the family moved from Houston to Denver. Their daughters were schooled from home for their high school years with their mother teaching them all of their mathematics (geometry through calculus and statistics) and physical sciences (physics and chemistry). Both now grown, the older (married) daughter works as a hospital nurse in Iowa and the younger soon-to-graduate daughter has an engineering position lined up in Idaho. Most importantly, both are faithful Christians in both confession and life. Besides teaching physics/chemistry and mathematics, Barbara’s interests include creation science apologetics, classical and sacred music (as her church pianist/organist), and various sports (tennis, skiing, hiking). Notably, she has presented numerous lectures relating science and Scripture in Sunday Bible classes and other venues ranging from Vacation Bible School to talk-radio.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "My philosophy of education is that content is of primary importance, being normed by the Scriptures as God’s word, the only infallible words of truth. For example, the books and articles that are read by students, including those used to teach reading, are of greater important than reading for the sake of being able to read. The same idea certainly carries over into the sciences (natural philosophy). Teaching that which is good, beautiful, and true, in all subject areas and at all academic levels (trivium, quadrivium), is unquestionably the goal of a classical Christian education. A faithful, confessing Christian teacher is of co-prime importance, being essential because education necessarily encompasses works (including textbooks) that fall short of these virtues to varying degrees and need norming. In fact, teaching that which is good, beautiful, and true must also include works depicting the opposite characteristics, by way of helping students distinguish good from evil, ugliness from beauty, and lies from truth in this fallen world where Satan, the father of lies, disguises himself as an angel of light (John 8:44; 2 Cor. 11:14), though such studies should generally wait until students are past the grammar stage in the literary sense as well as in age/maturity. Thus, the teacher himself must be normed by God’s word, having a worldview founded on the Triune God as Creator and Redeemer – which necessarily means he understands the Creation and Redemption accounts in Genesis and the Gospels to be truthful (factual, historical) – as he facilitates critical engagement in any given topic. That is, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.” (Prov. 9:10) Importantly, this science teacher acknowledges the historicity of the Genesis account as does the Lord Himself (Matt. 24: 37-39; Mark 10:6; Luke 3:38, 11:50-1, 17:26-7) and his apostles (Acts 17:24-7; Rom. 1:18-20, 5:12, 8:19-20; I Cor. 15: 21-2; 1 Pet. 3:20; 2 Pet. 2:5, 3:3-6), albeit implicitly. That is, Genesis chapter one is God’s own account (penned by Moses) of His Creation Ex Nihilo in six natural days some 6000 years ago (Gen. 5, 11; Luke 3) and Genesis chapters 6-9 describe a catastrophic global flood that profoundly impacted the earth's geology and in which all land animals and mankind perished save those on the ark.",
        "statement_of_faith": "Barbara and her husband Bob are members at Christ Our Savior Lutheran Church (LC‒MS) in Elizabeth, Colorado (Rev. Geoffrey Wagner). I (Barbara) confess the Faith using the Apostles' Creed and related portions of Luther's Small Catechism, as follows: I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. What does this mean? I believe that God has made me and all creatures; that He has given me my body and soul, eyes, ears, and all my members, my reason, and all my senses, and still takes care of them, he also gives me clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and home, wife and children, land, animals and all that I have; He richly and daily provides me with all that I need to support this body and life, protects me from all danger, and guards me and defends me from all evil; and all this he does out of fatherly, divine goodness and mercy, without any merit or worthiness in me; for all this it is my duty to thank, praise, serve and obey him. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. What does this mean? I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature, purchased and won me from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with His holy, precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death, in order that I may be [wholly] His own, and live under Him in His kingdom, and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, even as He is risen from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity. This is most certainly true. I believe in the Holy Ghost; one holy Christian Church, the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen. What does this mean? I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Ghost has called me by the Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith; even as He calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian Church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith; in which Christian Church He forgives daily and richly all sins to me and all believers, and at the last day will raise up me and all the dead, and will give to me and to all believers in Christ everlasting life. This is most certainly true.",

            "description": "Prerequisites: The student has successfully completed Algebra I plus one more year of higher mathematics whether Geometry or Algebra II. NOTE: While this is a 2 year course, the first year stands alone as an excellent and rigorous high school Physics I course with a dual enrollment option for college credit. The Project Physics II is the sequel to The Project Physics w/ Astronomy (or to most any first year high school physics course) also with dual credit option. The first year is worth 1.5 credits: 1.0 Physical Science and 0.5 Astronomy. The second year is worth 1.5 credits: 1.0 Physical Science and 0.5 Chemistry. The Project Physics w/ Astronomy course is preparatory for the AP Physics 1 exam and likewise The Project Physics II course for the AP Physics 2 exam. Also, both courses currently offer dual credit through Colorado Christian University as PHY 210-211-212 and PHY 310-311-312, respectively. However, a course's dual credit status with CCU is subject to change even after classes start in the Fall. The Project Physics is an integrated and classical course in physics, astronomy, chemistry (atom, nucleus, Periodic Table), and science processing skills with six units spanning two years in high school. The Project Physics w/ Astronomy includes historical astronomy and observational astronomy as its middle \"semester\" (Quarters 2-3) between Kinematics/Mechanics (Quarter 1) and Dynamics/Thermodynamics (Quarter 4). The Project Physics II includes units on the atom and the nucleus, recognizing the latter as particles moving within the former, both finding order in the Periodic Table and involving radiation so building on light as the first unit. Thus, chemistry is substantially included in the second year, like astronomy is in the first, making both years unique in comparison to the standard high school fare. The Project Physics Course text is superior to anything else I have encountered, rightly framing physics as man's humble exploration of the physical world rather than as a source of absolute truth. Designed for the college freshman pursuing a liberal arts degree, the text is beautifully written and a pleasure to read with its implicitly empirical approach, historical context, philosophical emphasis, and academic rigor, and is supplemented by selections from each unit’s Reader (a collection of related articles and essays by well-known physicists). – Dr. Helmkamp",

This Astronomy course includes historical astronomy using The Project Physics Course text and observational astronomy using The Stargazers' Guide to the Night Sky. Astronomy-only carries the successful completion of Algebra I as its only prerequisite. All course content is normed to the Holy Scriptures by a teacher who acknowledges the historicity of the Genesis account as does the Lord Himself (Matt. 24: 37-39; Mark 10:6; Luke 3:38, 11:50-1, 17:26-7) and his apostles (Acts 17:24-7; Rom. 1:18-20, 5:12, 8:19-20; I Cor. 15: 21-2; 1 Pet. 3:20; 2 Pet. 2:5, 3:3-6), albeit implicitly. That is, Genesis chapter one is God’s own account (penned by Moses) of His Creation Ex Nihilo in six natural days some 6000 years ago (Gen. 5, 11; Luke 3) and Genesis chapters 6-9 describe a catastrophic global flood that profoundly impacted the earth's geology and in which all land animals and mankind perished save those on the ark.",

        "bio": "I live in New Hampshire with my husband and children, but I have lived all across the United States and have visited all fifty. I am an Air Force veteran with 10+ years of experience turned homeschool educator with 20+ years of experience; I homeschooled our three children birth through 12th and beyond (we are life-long learners). Growing up as a preacher’s kid, I cut my teeth on the church pews; growing up as a teacher’s kid, I considered my mom’s classroom my second home. If I did not have my nose in a book, I was probably on a local tennis court. After graduating from the United States Air Force Academy in 1994 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Operations Research, I earned my Master’s Degree in Operational Analysis at the Air Force Institute of Technology, then served as an Air Force Space Systems Analyst in California and Information Warfare officer in Texas. I honorably separated from the Air Force to raise our children in 2000. My husband is a retired Air Force officer, now defense program manager, and we have three children: our eldest graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 2023 and is now in helicopter school, our middle is a soccer referee and pursuing her Accounting degree from Southern New Hampshire University, and our youngest attends Colorado Christian University, majoring in Engineering Project Management. Informally commencing homeschooling in 2001, we started with Sign with Your Baby, then moved to KONOS, Sonlight, and My Father’s World. In 2013 we discovered Classical Conversations, and I jumped in as a Director for Foundations and Essentials, then Challenge a year later. My years as a Challenge director in the math seminar and working with my own children tie my background of graduate-level mathematics to my present reality of teaching Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, and sometimes Physics with Kepler Education and Statistics with CCU Academy (Colorado Christian University.) As I learned to 'see' math and was trained to have math conversations, I am a self-proclaimed Math Geek-in-training. I'm pursuing my certificate of the “Great Tradition of Education” through Kepler's Adult Learning Program with Dr. Robert Woods. In addition to homeschooling, learning more about classical education, and especially spending time with my family, I enjoy scrapbooking, traveling, and coffee.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "The first question in the Westminster Shorter Catechism asks, 'What is the chief end of man?' and answers, 'Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever.' God’s word directs us how we may glorify and enjoy Him, including the following: seek Him, love Him with all we have, love our neighbor, pursue wisdom, make disciples, and train up a child (Matthew 6:33, 22:37, 39; Proverbs 4:5; Matthew 28:19; Proverbs 22:6) I believe in pursuing wisdom through knowledge and understanding, using the classical tools of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric viewed through a biblical lens. I believe our study is a form of worship to glorify God; that He reveals Himself as we seek Him in academic subjects. I believe in didactic instruction, dialectic questioning, and deliberate conversations. I believe education is more than utilitarian, that we should pursue truth, goodness, and beauty as we practice skills and tools of learning. I believe in a lifelong pursuit of learning, and God has a plan for the lives of all of us. I believe we are educating for eternity, not only this life’s servant-leaders and world-changers.",

The class and coursework are organized and arranged to first disorient students away from their preconceptions regarding mathematics. Next, students are immersed in a beautiful world of numbers to allow them a sense of the aesthetics of math. After those preparatory experiences, students are introduced to Euclid and learn to follow and create proofs, perform complex constructions, and think critically about the nature of geometry. In short, students will learn to think like mathematicians rather than mere computers.",

        "teaching_philosophy": "I love investing in students and leaders of all ages through teaching, writing, and speaking. I aim to help people learn lessons from the past, to inspire them to live wisely in the present. I love teaching because I love learning, and the pursuit of wisdom, in community with other learners. As a teacher, my goal is to help equip and train students to embark on a lifetime of learning. As a Christian, my goal is to help them think about everything in a way grounded in the Scriptures, and informed by the wisdom of the Christian tradition.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I believe in the historic doctrines of the Christian church. I affirm the absolute priority of the Holy Scriptures, and the interpretive authority of documents like the Nicene Creed. I affirm the points of belief and practice that have traditionally been part of Christian teaching (in regards to the sanctity of life, the meaning and practice of marriage, the nature of gender, etc.). Beyond my commitment to 'core,' or 'mere' Christianity, I love and value the Reformed tradition. By training and inclination, I affirm many of the distinctives of Reformed churches. But, like John Calvin and the other reformers, I also love and value our church fathers, and church mothers. I feel most at home in churches that worship according to the ancient liturgies of the church, but I also realize that God works through all sorts of worship styles and denominational structures, for His own purposes. One of my goals in all of my teaching is to help my students understand and appreciate the wisdom of the past, to equip them to live wisely in the present.",

History has the potential to be the most thrilling subject, but too often we bog it down with dates and facts, forgetting that history is about stories and people. And when history is not being reduced to a simplistic 3x5 card to memorize, the narrative is often being used to further identity politics. But to be able to properly make sense of the past, we must treat historical characters like real people, and not just reduce them to saints and sinners. The events of history are a fascinating tangle of reasons made by complex people just like us. Because of all this, history can be really daunting for people who both know how complex it is and also love how fun history can be, but they don't have the knowledge or time to spend trying to navigate all the materials.

The value I placed on that education stuck out to me prior to my attending seminary, when in 2020 we saw many changes throughout the world. I felt better equipped to understand where to turn for truth in that tumultuous time due largely in part to a foundation of understanding the importance of worldview, critical thinking, and an acknowledgement that this is God's world. That is my primary aim as an educator: to teach students that this is God's world and we are responsible for learning how to act and interact in light of that fact, that He's shown us how to do so in His Word, and, in my particular field of interest, to lean into the fact that God does communicate to us through a Book, and that reading well helps us better learn to live to His glory.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "My teaching philosophy draws from two inspirations. The first is the classical model of education, which I summarize as a \"how to think, not what to think\" model. Through the stages of grammar, logic, and rhetoric students learn how to understand facts and arguments, engage with those arguments, and formulate their own. The model makes critical thinkers and when coupled with an understanding of the sovereignty of God the Creator and the Lordship of Jesus Christ the Redeemer fuels an intellectually satisfying and spiritually mature understanding of the faith. My second inspiration is the benefit of proper expository preaching. Preaching done well is a model for reading well and it shows how to contextualize the objective nature of a text, read symbolism for what it truly points to in light of the objective, and draw right and true applications. This is the same objectives we need to strive for in a literature and writing course.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I believe in the historical Christian tradition which centers on the Creator God sending His Son Jesus Christ, truly God and truly man, to live a perfect life on behalf of sinful men, die the death man's sin warrants, and rise again to defeat death itself. That faith in Christ is the only means of salvation and it leads to a renewed heart and mind in which the Christian both bears the fruits of the Spirit and submits to the order of creation which God commands. More specifically, I hold to the theological distinctives of the Reformed Baptist tradition summed up theologically in the doctrines of total depravity (man's enslavement to sin to the extent that left to his own devices he is incapable of choosing to follow God), unconditional election (in which God, in spite of man's inability and lack of merit, draws some to come to saving faith before they have done either good or bad), limited or definite atonement (that Christ's death actually, effectually saved all who will come to Him and only those who will come to Him), irresistible grace (that the call of God upon unconditional election is not something that man can reject once it calls him in time), and the perseverance or preservation of the saints (that God will keep those He calls in the faith unto eternity). The Reformed tradition is also summed up in reference to the life of a believer in the five solas of the Reformation: Christians are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone to the glory of God alone and ruled in final authority by the Scriptures alone.",

        "name": "Ryan Griffiths",
        "bio": "Born and raised in the small midwestern city of Taylorville, I grew up absorbed in my own imagination: reading all the fantasy stories I could get my hands on, watching all of the adventure movies that came through the local theater, and trying my own hand at the craft of storytelling...as evidenced by a bedroom cluttered with spiral notebooks containing dozens of half-finished stories. It was good that my interests lay in the creative sphere, as there was never much else to do in a city surrounded on all sides by undulating vistas of cornfields. My love for Star Wars movies, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Disney animated classics inspired me to become a filmmaker, and I made it all the way to my senior year of high school in possession of some vague notion that I would probably go to film school. A handful of circumstances, however, dissuaded me from that notion. First, I grew frustrated that my amateur attempts at filming were constantly thwarted due to unreliable/unmotivated actors (which, in retrospect, is entirely understandable...after all, the casts consisted entirely of my unpaid circle of friends who had nothing else to do on the weekends). At the same time, my imagination was beginning to be captured not by movies, but by literature. I had always been an avid reader, but I now began to read not just with an eye toward entertainment, but toward emulation. Literature appealed to me over movies in that the creator was limited by nothing except their own imagination...and their grasp of the English language. Actors, props, CGI budgets...what mattered these to a novelist? I began to study how to paint the perfect scene in my readers' minds, how to write smooth-flowing and natural dialogue, how to structure a story so that all the elements came together into a harmonious whole. And the more I wrote, the more I read; these two loves nurtured each other and led me to the determination of seeking a degree in English studies. I attended the University of Illinois in Springfield, which was conveniently only a thirty minute drive or so from home, and for years I was kept pleasurably busy with readings both required by coursework as well as wherever my inclination led. Shakespeare, Dickens, and Victor Hugo became as familiar friends to me as Tolkien and C.S. Lewis had been (and still are). I earned my Bachelor's in English, and then stayed on for my Master's as well. All the while, I continued with my own writing and eventually produced a novel that I believed was at least worth a publisher's passing glance. After a year or so of failing to solicit the attention of either a literary agent or a publisher, I determined to start my own publishing company, CirrusPress. The company is still in existence (as is the novel) although the anticipated release date for the latter is forthcoming...though I can only hope not indefinitely. During this time, I worked as a substitute teacher at all grade levels in the various local school districts, as well as an independent tutor and a graduate assistant. I have also put on puppet shows for kindergarten classrooms, and started a YouTube channel on which I (admittedly infrequently) upload mini-lectures on Shakespeare's plays and other great books. Since then, I have worked as an adjunct English instructor at the University of Illinois, alongside my old professors. My students have been mostly freshman, and my courses include Critical Reading, Rhetoric and College Writing, and College Writing and Civic Engagement. These courses all have a heavy emphasis on rhetoric and composition, as well as research writing. As for hobbies...did I mention that I read a lot? Aside from that, I enjoy cycling on the 15-mile bike trail that cuts through many of those aforementioned cornfields, as well as playing chess and backgammon with friends at the local pizza restaurant where I used to work as a busboy.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "To undertake the task of teaching is no small thing. I believe that it requires someone with a very specific personality and outlook on life. At the risk of sounding grandiose, it is more of a calling than a career, and for those who profess the Christian faith, it is a duty. \"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves\" (2 Timothy 2:24-25a). Regardless of the subject, a poor teacher with little patience and no sense of purpose in their own vocation can turn a student away from that subject forever. I begin every class I have taught by encouraging my students to question, \"So What?\" of any topic we might be covering. It can be a nerve-wracking question sometimes, but it is one that is equally important for both the teacher to be able to answer and for the student to assure themselves of. The teacher must believe that what they are doing has value, has meaning, and the student must be convinced that their time in the classroom is well-spent. My answer to such a question (especially in regard to humanities courses) invariably comes back to the same idea. It's not just about teaching the texts, it's about a type of self-betterment: the growth of the student's worldview and critical thinking skills, as well as a deeper appreciation for the common heritage that they share with the great thinkers and writers of the past. Great literature shows us the heights and the depths of the human soul from enough of a distance to be able to reflect rationally upon what we have witnessed. Composition enables us to crystalize our wayward thoughts and see them laid out in an orderly fashion, as well as to express our desires to others without resorting to brute force; as the critic Wayne Booth says, \"The only real alternative to rhetoric is war.\" I can only hope that, even on bad days, my teaching style reflects the seriousness with which I take the profession. But how is one to instill this sense of importance in the students? It was my high school English teacher who inspired me to want to teach, and to this day my teaching philosophy largely strives to accomplish in my students what his lectures accomplished in me: he made these strange, seemingly inaccessible texts relevant to our daily lives. In his classroom, Beowulf and Macbeth became living personalities in which I and many other students recognized a shocking resemblance to ourselves and our relatively mundane struggles. Reading great works of literature never felt like homework...it was entertaining, and it felt like growth. I also try to emulate his habit of responding to student writing with earnest engagement, so that the students feel that their instructor is taking what they have to say seriously, and that they are making unique contributions to the class' undertaking of whatever text is being discussed. One of my greatest enjoyments of teaching is when a student writes an essay or makes a comment that makes me see a treasured novel or a familiar topic in an entirely new light. It is then that I know that the student thought about the text and made it their own, and also that my understanding of the text has deepened as well.",
        "statement_of_faith": "Though I grew up in a nominally Christian household with a belief in God, the resurrection of Christ, heaven, and hell, I do not believe that I became a truly born-again Christian until around the time I was twelve or thirteen years old. And after that, I do not believe that I became serious about my faith until I was twenty-three. The ten-year gap was mostly spent worrying about the things that teenagers tend to worry about, and it was only when I began attending college that I started to earnestly search for the reasons as to why I believed what I professed to believe, which led me to the study of apologetics. At the same time, a better understanding of my own sinful nature (and that I wasn't really the \"pretty good person\" I had always presupposed myself to be) led me to a deeper understanding of my relationship to God and of why the substitutionary death of Christ was so necessary for me to be accepted of God. Since then, time spent in prayer and reading the Bible has become an integral part of my daily routine. Although I attend a local nondenominational church (Taylorville Christian Church) and consider myself a nondenominational Christian (I have long held concerns that to align oneself with one particular group approximates the \"Apollos vs. Paul\" controversy of 1 Corinthians) I have found that my personal beliefs most closely resemble those of Baptist denominations. Below is my statement of faith regarding what I would consider to be essential doctrines; I believe that the Eternal God created all things by Jesus Christ (Ephesians 3:9) in the beginning of time (John 1:1-3); that God created mankind in his own image (Genesis 1:26-27) and that through experience of the created world man could come to know God (Romans 1:20-21). However, by the transgression of Adam sin entered into the world (Romans 5:12) and all of mankind are dead in trespasses and sin (Romans 3:10-12). I believe that Jesus Christ came to earth, God manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16), in order to free mankind from the wages of sin and save us by grace through our faith (Ephesians 2:1-9) in his death, burial, and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:1-4); that through acceptance of Jesus Christ as one's personal savior and asking for the forgiveness of one's sins (Romans 10:9-10), we can know that we have eternal life (John 3:16). I believe that after salvation, the Christian is eternally secure (Ephesians 1:13 & 4:30) through God's grace, not by any works of righteousness that man can do (Titus 3:5). I believe in the nature of the triune Godhead of God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Ghost (1 John 5:7); that these three are separate, yet equal in power and authority (Colossians 2:9). I believe that the Bible is the divinely inspired, perfectly preserved word of God (Psalm 12:6-7) and is the final authority in all matters of faith and practice for Christians today (2 Timothy 3:15). It is through scripture that we can learn about God and his purpose for us, as well as be assured of our salvation through Jesus Christ (1 John 5:10-13). I'm almost surely leaving something out, so perhaps it would be best to say in summation that I'm confident my beliefs accord with both the Apostles' and the Nicene Creeds, as well as Church thought throughout the centuries.",

My parents, especially my father, valued reading highly and so I was an avid reader growing up, but also enjoyed pursuing a musical interest as well. I attended Huntingdon College on a piano scholarship and graduated with a degree in both Music and English. I also received a Masters degree in Education at the Auburn campus in Montgomery and taught at a classical school for four years. I married my husband, Ross, in 1999, and we have three boys who I began homeschooling six years ago. For most of that time, we were heavily involved in a classical co-op which grew to well over 100 moms and kids and in which I taught, served on the board of directors, and wrote and compiled the humanities curriculum for the secondary grades. My hobbies are reading, sewing, and baking, and my family enjoys traveling, cheering on the Auburn Tigers, pampering our guinea pig, and debating everything from Dante to Star Wars.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "To paraphrase Charlotte Mason, I believe that what a student knows is not as important as how much a student cares about what he or she knows. To that end, I believe that a quality education for students consists both of reading works that inspire and challenge them and providing a format for them to discuss those works in a group setting with a teacher who is herself inspired and challenged by them. As an educator, my desire is that no student feel intimidated by the Great Books. Rather, I want to help students to see first and foremost, that the reason these books have endured for centuries and are still being read today is not because they are lofty and worthy of being contemplated by the wisest thinkers of our day, although they are that, but because they are at heart Great Stories, which can be read and enjoyed by people of all ages. I provide reading guides for student support as they tackle their focal weekly assignments to help them identify major points and themes in their reading and to formulate questions and ideas they can bring to class discussion. I also pair each literature selection with a selection from history in order to allow the student to simultaneously hear more than one voice from the time period being studied as well as a “living book” which provides a more recent but still valuable exploration of the periods or themes under discussion, all of which are read simultaneously at a moderate pace over several weeks in order to facilitate the student’s ability to ponder the books and make connections among two or three related streams of thought. I also provide an optional assignment drawn from movies, music, and other media that students are encouraged to complete, and which I will use in class discussion, as we explore how the Great Conversation is still taking place all around us. In class, I incorporate a Book of Centuries for chronological understanding as well as other tactile challenges and activities such as map work which dialectic students enjoy, in addition to the discussion that is the heart of our weekly meetings.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that He died for our sins, was resurrected and lives at the right hand of God. I believe this was necessary because mankind’s sin in a historical Garden of Eden irreparably separated him from God, and that from that time we have all been born with a sin nature. Only Christ, who is fully human and fully divine, was born sinless and lived a perfect life, which enabled Him to become the satisfactory sacrifice for sin that God’s justice required. I am a member of Morningview Baptist Church, which is a Southern Baptist Church, although Morningview teaches from a Reformed perspective and is affiliated with Founders Ministries. My husband and I were members of a PCA church for twenty years before we joined Morningview ten years ago. Most of the material I teach, however, was developed for a co-op in which we had a wide variety of denominations represented, although all were Protestant and Evangelical, and so I teach with this wider perspective in mind.",

        "bio": "In his magnum opus, The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoevsky introduces the reader to several characters whose words and actions represent particular worldviews. Ivan wrestles with atheism, as he cannot fathom that there could be a good God in light of such evil in the world. Dmitri struggles with hedonism as he seeks to bridle his passions. Their younger brother, Alyosha, carefully considers the teachings of his mentor, Father Zosima, and chooses the road less traveled, the road of faith and incarnation. The Alyosha Society is a group of curious bibliophiles who seek to hear the counsel of the many Zosimas of the past. Our goal is to consider what the great minds have pondered through the art of literature and philosophy and discuss how we might be faithful disciples of the true and living God. Founder and Teachers Bruce Etter Born in 1969 in West Virginia, I graduated high school in 1987 and studied Spanish and Bible during my undergraduate years. I graduated from Columbia International University in 1992 and married Julie in 1993. We have five children, adopted and biological. I have enjoyed teaching in Christian schools since 1992 and have served as both teacher and administrator in six different schools. While teaching in the 90's I completed a Master's Degree in Religion at Reformed Theological Seminary. Ever since I found out about classical education (late 1990's) I have been wholeheartedly dedicated to it. We moved to Pennsylvania in 2004 in order to be involved with Veritas Academy. I taught Spanish and Omnibus courses there for four years before embarking upon my journey in online education. I have had the privilege of teaching in both traditional (brick and mortar) settings and online schools. I also enjoyed trekking across Europe, recording self-paced courses, filming lessons on the locations where key events occurred. I currently serve in administration at Veritas Academy, Leola, PA and teach online courses through the organization I started in 2021, The Alyosha Society. I currently serve as an elder at Wheatland Presbyterian Church, P.C.A. and teach in the adult Sunday School. I spend all of my free time with my grandson, Eden.",

You will also learn how to resonate as a small group of writers, just like Tolkien, Lewis, and the Inklings. We will take some of your writing to the final stage, other projects will remain at a draft level, but you will have a writing portfolio at the end of the year.",

        "teaching_philosophy": "As far as educational philosophy goes, I tend to embrace two maxims, the first from probably too many sources to count and the second from a true friend to classical education, Charlotte Mason.\n\nThe first? “The enemy of the excellent is the good.” It recalls a principle of Pliny the Younger: multum non multa, meaning “not many, but much.” As a culture we are convinced that more is better, and as a result we tend to invest—with the best intentions—in too many classes, too many activities, too many THINGS to allow our children to dive deep into any one idea or passion, or to breathe and enjoy the process. Given our limited time, we should rather slow down whenever possible, resisting the temptation to add one more class, one more experience, if those good things compete with the things that matter most.\n\nThe second comes courtesy of Miss Mason, who wisely reminded us that “Children are born persons.” Because each child is an individual—with different interests, abilities, passions, etc.—no one curriculum, no one approach, no one philosophy is necessarily going to work best for all children…even children who have the same blood flowing through their veins. The path our oldest took to college looks a bit different than our second, radically different than our third, and a world away from our fourth. As homeschoolers, we have the opportunity to structure our children’s education to meet individual needs and aspirations while still spreading a gentle and varied feast before them.",

During our first semester together, students will learn to identify strong and weak arguments and interact with numerous informal fallacies of relevance, presumption, and clarity.

        "bio": "Aaron Hebbard grew up in a Christian home and grew into Christ from an early age. At age 18 as a senior in high school, 'Heb' felt the call into the ministry of the Word, which was refined in college to be carried out in the academic arena. After completing his doctorate and in the midst of his collegiate teaching, Heb’s call to the ministry of the Word was expanded to the Church as well as academia.\n\nHeb taught in Christian secondary education for 10 years since 1993, and Christian higher education since 2001 as Professor of Theology and the Arts. He earned his Bachelor's and Master's Degrees from Vanguard University in Biblical Studies in 1992 and 1996. In 2005 Heb earned his Doctorate (Ph.D.) from the University of Glasgow in the field of Literature, Theology and the Arts. As a theological interdisciplinarian, Heb has a passion for taking all thoughts captive to the obedience of Christ across the academic disciplines. He has founded Imago Dei College as a dual enrollment and gap year program that disciples students in a robust biblical worldview, while giving transferable college credit. Heb has also planted two churches: Covenant Church in 2016 and Remnant Church in 2020, both with the passion to witness and foster a biblical reformation of family, church and culture.\n\nHeb and his lovely wife Nicole have been married since 1991 and together they have six children—three boys and three girls—all of whose names are reflections of significant biblical themes. Added to our blessings are married-in sons and daughter as well as five grandchildren.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "Education is one in the same with a comprehensive discipleship model devoted to taking all thoughts captive to the obedience to Christ. We can know nothing apart from the gracious revelations of God, who reveals knowledge, understanding and wisdom that we might come to know Him and make Him known all the better. Through true knowledge we can fulfill the great commands that the Lord has assigned to us, such as loving Him with our whole hearts, souls, mind, and strengths; loving our neighbors as ourselves; and teaching/discipling the nations to obey the teachings of Christ. The biblical progression of education takes into the account the drama of redemption. The first stage in our philosophy of education states that man is made in the image of God and therefore, has the innate ability to comprehend the things that the Lord reveals and intends us to know. This drives us to think clearly and creatively about the world in which we are placed that we might reflect His dominion. But with the introduction of sin in Adam, we are all infected to the degree that comprehending and apprehending the knowledge of the Lord is now far more arduous of a task. The only solution is to have our minds renewed by the Spirit into the true image of God, Jesus Christ Himself, which brings us to the next stage of education, that we are to be restored in our image of Christ and to come to the realization that the fear of the Lord is the foundation of knowledge, understanding and wisdom. The third stage of our educational discipleship is the recognition and commitment to lifelong sanctification; a constant effort to renew the mind while resisting conformity to the thinking patterns of the world. Lastly, we come to rejoice in the fact that one day we will be glorified in our thinking and unhampered by the presence of sin that we might spend eternity learning of the glories of the Lord unimpeded by sinful nature or the fear of death.",

It has blossomed into a love for training young people and finding beauty amidst the creation in both literature and visual art. I coached and taught in multiple secular institutes then had the privilege before having my own children to teach using Montessori concepts in the Dominican Republic but as our family grew beyond two, we decided my job was training and nurturing our own. Those sectors of education always felt lacking because they were detached from the Bible. After staying home for many years, God paved His way for me to go back into the classroom part time at the Classical Christian School my children had been attending where I developed and implemented a Pre-K curriculum and instituted an artist of the month curriculum. As the needs of the school grew, I transitioned to the kindergarten teacher and built on the artist of the month curriculum. God has opened the door for us to homeschool our children and the opportunity also presented itself for me pursue a master’s in liberal arts at the University of St. Thomas where I chose a focus in Art History. I enjoy getting to read the classics and discuss the deep literature along with pursuing art, which is a love of mine. In this new adventure of homeschooling, I have also found great enjoyment in learning Latin alongside my younger three, which surprised me. Other enjoyments for me would include adventuring the trails of Arkansas and creating things that range from paper crafts like cards to knitting and sewing. Throughout my life, I can see God’s hand in guiding me to a place to disciple children, so it was no wonder that the secular institutes left a hole. Today, I am grateful for His leading me to this understanding that without the biblical world view there is no right view and in that the importance of not just sharing and scripting out who God is but showing it through the Good, the True, and the Beautiful.",

It encompasses a training of the Biblical world view in which all subject matters are interwoven with God and how he sees the world.

As a Christian educator I desire to push students to do their best to honor the Lord with all their hand finds to do, to open their eyes and explore the wonder of the world around them and to see the many beauties of the world God has created. I find it important to expose students to as many good and beautiful things as possible while encouraging the love of learning through wonder and leisure.

        "teaching_philosophy": "The teaching philosophy is one of the most vital viewpoints that an educator must consider throughout his or her teaching profession. My teaching philosophy has transformed over time as a consequence of additional training, new learning environments, and, most significantly, interaction with students. The foundation of my teaching philosophy is my belief that all individuals can learn; and, it is the obligation of the educator to assist the student in acquiring knowledge through different modalities. Romans 12:7 explains that if a person’s gift is teaching, then that person is to teach well. When an educator encounters a student who is struggling, the educator has the opportunity to learn how to help another individual learn, which enhances the educator’s abilities to teach well in the future.\n\nFrom traditional philosophy, I synthesize specific aspects from essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, and progressivism to develop my teaching philosophy. The elements of essentialism and perennialism that I integrate are the focus on basic skills and training of the intellect for all students. I believe there are specific thinking skills and a knowledge base that all individuals must know and understand. From constructivism, I incorporate the beliefs that students must be actively involved in and make sense of learning experiences. Learning and teaching are active verbs not passive verbs. For an individual to gain knowledge and wisdom, he or she must become active in the learning process. Progressivism provides the foundation for student-focused learning and problem-solving skills. Individuals can follow specialized fields of study, or cognates, through student-driven education. Problem-solving skills are vital to every aspect of modern life and provide opportunities to overcome challenges that arise.\n\nThe final amalgamation of the diverse philosophies provides a teaching philosophy that is Christian-based, truth-seeking, actively learning, develops problem-solving, and encourages the student to specialize in an area that draws their attention. As a Christian educator, my calling directs me to assist students in their educational pursuits, provide them with tools to achieve their goals, and encourage each individual to answer the call God has placed on their lives. Paul stated in 1 Corinthians 9:22 that he became all things to all people in order to save some. My philosophy guides me to become the educator that each student needs so that he or she may go out into the world and be the light that Christ called us to be.",
        "statement_of_faith": "My personal faith in Christ began with attending church as a child. However, in my mid-teen years, my dearest friend, my grandmother, passed away and I doubted God and experienced deep depression. It was through a genuine life-changing encounter with God that I became a dedicated Christian. I surrendered to Christ and the depression was lifted from my life. I know from personal experiences that Christ is the Great Physician, Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.\n\nI found God, and I found peace. I believe that He created the world. Jesus is the redeemer of the world through His crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. Sin entered the world through the Fall. I believe each person can choose to serve Christ so that they may have everlasting life. In order for a person to have salvation, they must believe in Christ, repent for their sins, be baptized, have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and live a life separate from sin. Through our fallen nature, we are born in sin and must die daily (1 Corinthians 15:31). I know that I fall short of the Glory of God (Romans 3:23), but through Christ I have redemption. I look forward to the day when I stand before His Majesty.",

One major source will be Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. In a weekly 90-minute session, we discuss the lecture and the assigned readings.",

        "name": "Katherine Łastowiecka",
        "bio": "Katie Łastowiecka grew up in Northwest Arkansas where she was homeschooled alongside her three siblings. She echoes the sentiment of Beatrix Potter: “Thank goodness I was never sent to school; it would have rubbed off some of the originality.” Her experience learning in the world rather than separated from it greatly influenced her views on education. Her days were spent picking blackberries in the woods, playing the piano, and listening to her mother read world history by the fireplace.\n\nShe attended the honors program at a state college where she fostered her love of Shakespeare, and even spent a summer as a dramaturg for the Arkansas Shakespeare Theater. An honors course titled “What Makes Us Human” was her first introduction to the ancients: The Odyssey, Antigone, The Oresteia, The History of the Peloponnesian War, etc. Needless to say, she was hooked. Little did she know, she would come to teach many of these texts with the same zeal of her professor.\n\nHer decision to obtain a masters in education was largely motivated by her own lack of high 'real school experience.' 'Best to know what school is like before I commit my life to working in one' she thought to herself. Though she would not gain classroom experience until she became a substitute teacher while finishing her thesis. In the end, the greatest example of teaching turned out to be her mother, who influenced Katie’s teaching instincts more than she could have guessed. Often called “Embodied Learning” or “Experiential Learning,” Katie imagined her classroom to be one filled with energy and engagement rather than rows of students filling in bubbles.\n\nKatie spent several years at a private Catholic school teaching Humane Letters, Theology, Creative Writing, Philosophy of the Human Person, and Drama, though not all at the same time. By her final year, she was the Dean of Mentoring as well. This time in the classroom allowed her to try different approaches to instruction and classroom management. As she had hoped, her classroom was always busy with poetry recitations, Shakespeare scenes being acted out, even the occasional Pride and Prejudice tea party.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Katie married a handsome architect from Chicago who shares her love of puns and philosophical conversation. She currently resides in Arkansas where she enjoys gardening with her husband, traveling, writing, and grain-free baking.",
        "teaching_philosophy": "To paraphrase Maritain, the purpose of education is to teach man how to keep forming himself, hopefully into something more true, good, and beautiful. This is the foundation of my teaching. The goal is to help students learn how to discern what is true, how to love what is good, and how to pursue transcendent beauty.\n\nRather than tell my students what to think, I care much more that they know how to think and then express those thoughts articulately, concisely, and eloquently. As a teacher in the humanities, I aim to aid my students to grow in empathy and good judgment by reading stories. I want to confront them with stories that do not test the memorization of an arbitrary set of facts, but stories that test their strength of character, their virtue.\n\nI believe that students need to be held responsible for their work the same way I am responsible for mine. Setting high standards for work and maintaining deadlines are simple ways to help students pursue excellence and grow in the virtues of obedience, prudence, and temperance as they manage their time and work accordingly. I also believe that learning should be fun because that is one of the greatest ways to ensure that lessons are not forgotten. However, fun is only possible if students come to class prepared and open minded. Therefore the art of learning may only take place if both the teacher and student take responsibility for their work and properly prepare to engage with each other and the material.",
        "statement_of_faith": "I am a practicing Catholic at St. Joseph’s parish in Fayetteville, Arkansas. As such, I believe in the dignity of all humans and the possibility of redemption for those who seek it, the existence of objective truths, transcendental beauty that directs our gaze heavenward, redemptive suffering, and the fact that we are all in constant need of God’s grace. I believe in the trinity, sacred scripture and tradition, and the sacraments.\n\nMy personal faith is the foundation of my daily life; my days begin and end with prayer. I view my vocation as a teacher, the literature I teach, and my personal relationships through a christian lens and strive to serve my students, family, and community the way Christ would.",

Through the death, burial, and resurrection Jesus demonstrates that God is a just, but loving God who seeks restoration and relationship with His people. The invitation is extended to all people. The Church has the privilege and responsibility of introducing people to Jesus by sharing the Gospel with grace, love, and truth. Whereas the Church has the duty to share the invitation of the Gospel, only the Holy Spirit can convict any person. I believe that the triune nature of God is a beautiful mystery that is not fully comprehensible to humankind but is nonetheless experienced by one who walks with God in truth and wisdom. I believe in the unity but diversity of the Church. The unity is based on the core essentials of the Gospel which transcends culture and race. Subsequently, the Church unity provides strong testimony in a very divided modern culture. I believe that humans are called to worship the Lord with body, mind, and soul. When the body, mind, and soul actively seek and participate in truth, beauty, and goodness, genuine worship takes place. I believe that a challenged and engaged mind is a necessary part of worship. I belong to a local church where I teach and participate in adult Bible study courses.",
