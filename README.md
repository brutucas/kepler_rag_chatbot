## Initial Consultation and Needs Assessment

The project commenced with a consultation to identify specific needs, including:

- A website that was somewhat clunky and difficult to navigate.
- Challenges in providing detailed information about courses and teachers.
- Inefficient communication processes resulting in high email volumes.
- A need for a more effective method to handle visitor inquiries and conversions.

## Data Collection and Processing

### Data Collection

Data was initially scraped from the Kepler Education website, focusing on courses and teacher information. This data was initially stored in a JSON file.

### Data Handling

During initial testing with a Streamlit frontend, it was discovered that a list of strings was more effective than JSON. This approach allowed for:

- **Easier Updates**: Simplified maintenance and integration of new text data.
- **Improved Reliability**: More consistent chatbot responses.
- **Efficient Data Integration**: Quick incorporation of new information, such as refund policies, Kepler Quad community details, and future events.

## Chatbot Development

### Initial Challenges

The initial chatbot faced some challenges, including:

- **Glitches**: Occasional reliability issues.
- **Prompt Tweaking**: Necessity for fine-tuning to enhance response accuracy.

### Solution and Improvement

Switching to a list of strings significantly improved the chatbot’s performance. Benefits included:

- **Easy Updates**: Simplified addition of new information.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Reduced glitches and more consistent responses.

## Ongoing Responsibilities

As the designated chatbot expert for Kepler Education, my responsibilities include:

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitoring the chatbot’s performance and making necessary adjustments.
- **Updating Content**: Incorporating new documents and information to ensure the chatbot remains current.

## Outcomes and Learnings

The project provided valuable insights and experience:

- **Real-World Application**: Gained experience working with a real business and addressing specific needs.
- **Effective Solutions**: Delivered a practical solution that improved user engagement and streamlined communication.

## Future Work

- **Website Revamp**: Collaborate on future website improvements and enhancements.
- **Ongoing Updates**: Continue to refine the chatbot based on user feedback and new information.
